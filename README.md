- 👋 Hi, I’m Niklas
- 👀 I’m interested in Hifi and DSP implementation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to setup camilladsp with RPI4 and looking forward to the journey following after.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on integration of different interfaces and DSP knowledge although I will probably be on the receiving end for a little while as I am new to this.
- 📫 Reach me per PM :)
